1 \.  NorthLight School (NLS) is committed to a high standard of compliance with accounting , financial reporting, internal controls and auditing requirements and any legislation relating thereto. All Directors and Staff are expected to maintain high standards of business and personal ethics, honesty and integrity in carrying out their duties and responsibilities and to conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times to bring credit to and enhance the image of the company.

2 \.   Whistle-blowing is the act of reporting misconduct within an organization and this policy provides an avenue for directors, employees and external parties to bring to the attention of the Board any misdeed or impropriety committed by the directors, management and staff of the company. The policy also offers them reassurance that they will be protected from reprisals or victimisation for whistle-blowing in good faith.

##### RESPONSIBILITY

4 \.  The Board Chairman, Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee, and the School Principal shall be the team authorised to investigate all concerns raised.

5 \.  Where the concern raised is against one of the team members, the other members may appoint additional directors or school management members to assist in the investigation. 

6 \.  The Vice-Principal (Administration) and Manager (Finance & Procurement) are responsible to keep the policy updated and communicate the information to stakeholders including via the school website and other appropriate platforms e.g. staff contact time, school intranet.
