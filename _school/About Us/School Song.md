## SCHOOL SONG

**REQUIRE JACKSON INPUT AUDIO**

<center>
	Like the stars in the sky<br>
Shining bright day and night<br>
I do believe I have the strength<br>
To go the distance come what may<br><br>
	Innovations we create<br>
With a team that collaborates<br>
We will excel and do our part<br>
And embrace honesty to heart<br><br>
	Chorus:<br>
NorthLight we stand with pride<br>
With love and integrity<br>
We dare to strive<br>
For a better life<br>
NorthLight I believe in you and me<br><br>
	Every day we appreciate<br>
The lessons learnt and celebrate<br>
I do believe I can succeed<br>
Believe in my talents and my dreams<br><br>
	Chorus:<br>
NorthLight we stand with pride<br>
with love and integrity<br>
We dare to strive<br>
For a better life<br>
Northlight I believe in you and me<br><br>
	Bridge:<br>
There may be times when things just don’t turn out right<br>
I do believe that I can make a change and shine out bright<br><br>
	Chorus:<br>
NorthLight we stand with pride<br>
With love and integrity<br>
We dare to strive<br>
For a better life<br>
NorthLight I believe in you and<br>
NorthLight I believe in you and me<br><br>
