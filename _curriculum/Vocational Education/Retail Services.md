**Industry Experiential Programme (IEP)**

As part of the ITE Skills Certificate (ISC) assessment, final year students are required to fulfil their IEP comprising 9 weeks of industry attachment in Year 4. Their IEP is graded by industry supervisors based on the studentsâ€™ performance.

Internships offer students with hands-on opportunity to work in their desired field and the experience to see what it is like actually working in the real work environment. They will not only learn how their course of study applies to the real world but also gain invaluable insight to evaluate the types of jobs that match their personal interests and personality for their future career path. It also serves as a platform for students to improve social, communication and technical skills needed for their working life upon graduation.
