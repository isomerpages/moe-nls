**PHYSICAL EDUCATION & SPORTS WELLNESS**<br>
As one of three main pillars of character development and holistic education, Physical Education & Sports Wellness (PE SW) curriculum serve to imbibe in our students the importance of teamwork, resilience, creative problem solving and character & values formation as part of 21 Century CC. The PE SW Department's curriculum is designed to ensure that students' learning is made experiential, and fun as most of our students are kinaesthetic and visual learners. The environment our students are exposed to is created deliberately to ensure that their learning is purposeful and nurtures meaningful socio-emotional development. Underpinning the SW curriculum is the philosophical intent NLS PE 2.0 which is premised on the acronym M.O.V.E-Multuple Opportunities for Varied Experiences. These opportunities further serve to enhance our students' P.I.E.S (Physical, Intellectual, Emotional & Social). Additionally, the PE SW curriculum is developmentally progressive in that it begins with Exposure (different sports, skills and knowledge) to Familiarization through Practise, leading on to Refinement and finally Consolidation.

**DISCIPLINE**<br>
At NorthLight, we see discipline as educational process to develop students intellectually and morally so that sound values are inculcated and lived out on a daily basis. Our goal is to nurture our students into self-disciplined individuals.

We believe in disciplining with care. When we discipline a student, it is not to inflict pain but for the student to learn. Our key approaches include creating a supportive environment and sustainable programmes that focus on success rather than failure. We seek to teach components of good character via social emotional learning through daily routines that will reflect our school values. Teachers and students will also model good behaviour and affirm positive actions. Students who have erred in their behaviour will be re-directed and guided towards the right direction and will take ownership of choices that they make.

We hope that with love, care and clear established rules, our students will choose to live out the school’s values and be responsible in creating a positive learning environment.
