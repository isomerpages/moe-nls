## DISCIPLINE

<img src="/images/Discipline-2021.jpg" style="width:85%">

At NorthLight, we see discipline as educational process to develop students intellectually and morally so that sound values are inculcated and lived out on a daily basis. Our goal is to nurture our students into self-disciplined individuals.

We believe in disciplining with care. When we discipline a student, it is not to inflict pain but for the student to learn. Our key approaches include creating a supportive environment and sustainable programmes that focus on success rather than failure. We seek to teach components of good character via social emotional learning through daily routines that will reflect our school values. Teachers and students will also model good behaviour and affirm positive actions. Students who have erred in their behaviour will be re-directed and guided towards the right direction and will take ownership of choices that they make.

We hope that with love, care and clear established rules, our students will choose to live out the school’s values and be responsible in creating a positive learning environment.

##### NLS DISCIPLINE FRAMEWORK

<img src="/images/DisciplineFramework.jpg" style="width:85%">

**Motto:**<br>
Every child matters. Every teacher is a discipline teacher.

**Mission:**<br>
To nurture students to be self-disciplined individuals who effectuate their values effectively.

**Rationale:**<br>
NorthLight School enrols students from different backgrounds. The unique student profile is testament to the school’s focus on striking a balance between nurturing potential and learning through experience.

NLS strives to create an environment of trust and responsibility through the STAR approach. For the Discipline Framework model, STAR is centered on our belief that every child matters. STAR’s effectiveness is correlated to our expectation that every teacher is a discipline teacher in NLS.
