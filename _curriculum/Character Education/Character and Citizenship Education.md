**Character and Citizenship Education**

**Our Mission :**

Nurturing students to be self-disciplined individuals that live out their values effectively. NLS aims to look into Character Development of NorthLight students which is centered on goals in the school’s Strategic Thrusts 1 & 2:

Strategic Thrust 1: Developing Character and Good Citizens

Strategic Thrust 2: Providing Career-Oriented and Skills-Focused education

The NorthLight School CCE Framework is anchored on the school motto “Never Give Up”. The school believes that in order for students to be resilient and confident global citizens, they need to have strength in character. This strength in character comes from within and every NLS student should learn to do his/her best and to embody the motto of “Do Your Best”.

##### CCE DEPARTMENT PROGRAMMES

*   Values-based Assembly
*   At-risk & Engagement Programmes
*   NorthLight Programme
*   NE Programmes
*   Values in Action (VIA)
*   Student Leadership
*   Reward & Recognition

##### WE AIM TO DEVELOP OUR STUDENTS TO BE

*   Confident persons with a mindset of excellence and integrity.
*   Active team players who can communicate effectively
*   Engaged learners with a passion for learning and a sense of responsibility
*   Concerned citizens who are caring and respectful

We are guided by the NLS CCE Framework which is based on the belief that education is about developing the child holistically. Centred on the NLS vision and mission, this framework focuses on the knowledge, skills and values which we hope to inculcate in our students to equip them to be citizens of good character and lifelong learners. Our student development efforts are guided by three big ideas – Identity, Relationship and Choices. The framework is supported by learning structures for instructional and non-instructional programmes. Eventually, we hope to nurture our students holistically so that we are able to achieve the eight CCE learning outcomes (LOs).

##### Figure 1: NorthLight School Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Framework  

The NLS CCE framework is represented by a Swiss roll. In NLS, a sound CCE curriculum and framework forms the core of education for our students. Having good values, strength in character and citizenship serve as a moral compass to help our students to steer through life.

a) Core Values<br>
Aligned to the Framework for 21CC and Student Outcomes, the SHINE values (Sincerity, Honesty, Innovation, Networking and Excellence) in NLS form the core of the NLS CCE Framework as core values are fundamental for a NorthLight student to be a person of good character and to be a useful citizen of Singapore who develops to be a lifelong learner.
