| The 6 guiding principles of MOE's Sexuality Education are:  <br><br>*   Parents play the primary role in educating their children and are responsible for teaching and transmitting values on sex and sexuality.  *   Our educators will impart knowledge, skills and values that reflect Singapore's mainstream society so that students will make informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.  <br>*   Aligned with our national values of encouraging heterosexual married couples to have healthy relationships with each other, and to build stable nuclear family units with extended family support.  <br>*   Only specially selected and trained teachers will teach Sexuality Education in our schools.  <br>*   Students and teachers are to respect the different attitudes, values and beliefs that different communities may have.  <br>*   Relevant community resources that are aligned and approved by MOE may be used to supplement schools' programmes.  | The MOE Sexuality Education curriculum is organised around 5 themes:  <br><br>1 \.  Human development: the onset of puberty and its psychological and emotional impact.  <br>2 \.  Interpersonal relationships: the skills and values for healthy and rewarding relationships with friends and family, including the opposite sex.  <br>3 \.  Sexual health: information and attitudes to promote sexual health and avoid unwanted consequences of sexual behaviour.  <br>4 \.  Sexual behaviour: expressions of sexuality and their effects.  <br>5 \.  Culture, society and law: societal, cultural and legal influences on sexual identity and sexual expressions.  |
