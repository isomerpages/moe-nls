*   Physical: Physical changes during sexual maturity.  
    
*   Emotional: Sexual attitudes and feelings towards self and others.  
    
*   Social: Sexual norms and behaviour, and the legal, cultural and societal implications.

| The 6 guiding principles of MOE's Sexuality Education are:  <br><br>*   Parents play the primary role in educating their children and are responsible for teaching and transmitting values on sex and sexuality.  *   Our educators will impart knowledge, skills and values that reflect Singapore's mainstream society so that students will make informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.  <br>*   Aligned with our national values of encouraging heterosexual married couples to have healthy relationships with each other, and to build stable nuclear family units with extended family support.  <br>*   Only specially selected and trained teachers will teach Sexuality Education in our schools.  <br>*   Students and teachers are to respect the different attitudes, values and beliefs that different communities may have.  <br>*   Relevant community resources that are aligned and approved by MOE may be used to supplement schools' programmes.  | The MOE Sexuality Education curriculum is organised around 5 themes:  <br><br>1 \.  Human development: the onset of puberty and its psychological and emotional impact.  <br>2 \.  Interpersonal relationships: the skills and values for healthy and rewarding relationships with friends and family, including the opposite sex.  <br>3 \.  Sexual health: information and attitudes to promote sexual health and avoid unwanted consequences of sexual behaviour.  <br>4 \.  Sexual behaviour: expressions of sexuality and their effects.  <br>5 \.  Culture, society and law: societal, cultural and legal influences on sexual identity and sexual expressions.  |

**Overview of NorthLight School Family Education**

In NorthLight School, SEd is conducted during Family Education lessons which are part of the Northlight Programme. The customised school curriculum incorporates the Growing Years curriculum as well as eTeens talks and classroom based learning (Year 3) This allows us to take a holistic approach which aligns to our students’ profile. Our lessons are founded on 5 broad based themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour and Culture, Society and Law.

1 \.  The goals of Sexuality Education are to:

*   To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate knowledge on human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;
*   To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships through the acquisition of social and emotional skills of self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and decision-making skills; and
*   To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society, through the inculcation of positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality.

2 \.  The key messages of Sexuality Education are:

*   Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;
*   Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);
*   Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and
*   Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.

4 \.  The NorthLight Programme Family Education incorporates topics on sexuality.

**Growing Years (GY) Programme:**

*   “The Teenage Years (2nd Edition)” (Lower Sec) Teaching & Learning resource package
*   “Sense & Sexuality (2nd Edition)” (Upper Sec) Teaching & Learning resource package

5 \.  The values and attitudes of our youth towards sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure to the media, popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find his/her own identity and often struggles with new social relationships. The period of middle adolescence (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various activities (including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong, and hinder one’s ability to act responsibly. Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from within themselves and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding of the possible consequences of sexual behaviour.

6 \.  Through “The Teenage Years” and “Sense & Sexuality” packages, students will have the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem, develop their character, and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills to deal with various issues related to sexuality, which are of prime concern at this age.
