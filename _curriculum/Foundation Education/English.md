**VISION**<br>
The ability to speak and write English effectively is an essential skill in the workplace. In support of NLS’s mission to provide an engaging career oriented education for youth and prepare them for lifelong learning and employability, **the Language and Literacy Programme seeks to prepare students to be _effective communicators_ in the main language of work and business, as well as to facilitate future skills upgrading**.

**CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK**<br>
The EL Curriculum Framework is illustrated in the five-pointed star below:

**APPROACH**<br>
The following approaches to language learning are embodied in the syllabus for NLS, and aligned to the MOE principles of engaged learning. Each point of the five-pointed star forms integral **P.A.R.T.S.** of the EL framework, helping us to achieve our goal to produce competent and confident communicators.

*   **Positive Learning Environment \[Tone of environment\]**  
A major factor for the success of the programme is the role of the teacher as a facilitator and a mentor, who is able to create an open and safe environment for learning. The quality of facilitator-learner interaction is critical to the success of the programme. Language is best acquired in a fun-filled and non-threatening environment. Learners thrive in a safe environment that provides many opportunities for language as well as respect for one another’s efforts. Peers are encouragers and teachers are facilitators and mentors.
*   **Assessments \[Assessment for learning\]**  
A variety of diagnostic, formative and summative assessments are used in NLS to support instruction. Student needs are diagnosed upon admission using Dolch List and informal assessment tools which ascertain students reading age and understand their learning gaps to provide appropriate intervention measures. The same tools are used at the end of each year to provide an indication of how far individual students have progressed in their reading literacy. Formative Assessments which include pre-test and posts tests will allow teachers to gauge where their students are at in their language development which will help them design lessons and select materials that meet students’ learning needs. They will use the pre and post-tests results to better cater to the learning needs of their students by doing item or error analysis. School-based formative assessments include vocabulary, comprehension, retelling, high frequency word and reading tests that form 60-70% of the students’ grades and give a sense of at which stage of the reading process the child is finding difficulty and guides subsequent interventions. Weak readers tend to have difficulties in decoding and have limited print vocabulary, while stronger readers struggle with fluency and problems with reading comprehension. A semestral common test completes the final 30-40% of the English marks. As a final summative assessment, the school adopts the WSQ (workforce skills qualifications system) listening, reading, writing and speaking assessments which is administered for all the students at the end of the Y4. The school targets 80% of students to obtain Level 4 or higher, which gives an indication of how successful the programme has been in preparing students with a sufficient level of literacy for the workplace.
