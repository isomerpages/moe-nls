**ICT CURRICULUM**<br>
Information Communication Technology (ICT) is one of the three core curricula under the Foundation Education Programme at NorthLight School. Students follow a formal course of study from Year 1 to 3 and apply the knowledge and skills acquired in other subject disciplines and areas.

The design of the curriculum aims to provide opportunities for students to perform effectively in school, community and workplace through developing:

*   Competency in ICT knowledge and skills.
*   Confidence and desire for life-long learning in ICT.
*   Character Education â€“ be aware of the value and impact of ICT and put this knowledge and skill into action.

**CURRICULUM COMPONENTS**<br>
The ICT programme comprises four components namely Skills, Cyberwellness, Project Work and Habits of Mind.

| Curriculum Component  | Content  |
|:-:|---|
| Skills  | The Skills component equips students to be competent users of Microsoft productivity tools (Presentation, Document processing and Spreadsheets). The skills are taught in a progressive approach through hands-on learning tasks and application.  |
| Cyberwellness  | The Cyberwellness component is aligned to MOE's Cyber Wellness Framework and advocates a Sense-Think-Act-Responsibly approach in the use of cyber space.  <br><br>Cyberwellness education is integrated as part of the ICT curriculum and supplemented with school-based programmes.  |
| Project Work  | The Project Work component anchors on the Maker Spirit which involves students in collaborative tasks to create technology-enabled artefacts.  <br><br>Students develop computational thinking through learning about basic block-based programming and work with one another in groups towards a common goal.  |
| Habits of Mind  | The Habits of Mind (HOM) component is incorporated into the ICT curriculum, in line with the whole-school approach to inculcate good learning habits and thinking dispositions among our students.  |
