**ICT CURRICULUM**<br>
Information Communication Technology (ICT) is one of the three core curricula under the Foundation Education Programme at NorthLight School. Students follow a formal course of study from Year 1 to 3 and apply the knowledge and skills acquired in other subject disciplines and areas.

The design of the curriculum aims to provide opportunities for students to perform effectively in school, community and workplace through developing:

*   Competency in ICT knowledge and skills.
*   Confidence and desire for life-long learning in ICT.
*   Character Education – be aware of the value and impact of ICT and put this knowledge and skill into action.

**CURRICULUM COMPONENTS**<br>
The ICT programme comprises four components namely Skills, Cyberwellness, Project Work and Habits of Mind.

| Curriculum Component  | Content  |
|:-:|---|
| Skills  | The Skills component equips students to be competent users of Microsoft productivity tools (Presentation, Document processing and Spreadsheets). The skills are taught in a progressive approach through hands-on learning tasks and application.  |
| Cyberwellness  | The Cyberwellness component is aligned to MOE's Cyber Wellness Framework and advocates a Sense-Think-Act-Responsibly approach in the use of cyber space.  <br><br>Cyberwellness education is integrated as part of the ICT curriculum and supplemented with school-based programmes.  |
| Project Work  | The Project Work component anchors on the Maker Spirit which involves students in collaborative tasks to create technology-enabled artefacts.  <br><br>Students develop computational thinking through learning about basic block-based programming and work with one another in groups towards a common goal.  |
| Habits of Mind  | The Habits of Mind (HOM) component is incorporated into the ICT curriculum, in line with the whole-school approach to inculcate good learning habits and thinking dispositions among our students.  |

NorthLight School Cyber Wellness programme is designed to create cyber awareness by instilling values in our students so that they can be safe and make respectful and responsible decisions online.

The school reaches out to students through classroom teaching, assembly talks, learning journeys and campaigns.

The curriculum is guided by the two foundational principles of **'Respect for Self and Others'** and **'Safe and Responsible Use'** and delivers **four key messages**

*   Embrace ICT yet maintain balanced lifestyle between the physical and cyber world
*   Harness the power of ICT for positive purposes
*   Maintain a positive presence in cyber space
*   Be a safe and responsible user of ICT

Lessons are delivered through **four themes**:

*   Cyber Use – balanced life and balanced use
*   Cyber Identity – healthy self-identity
*   Cyber Relationships – safe and meaningful relationships
*   Cyber Citizenship – positive presence

Newspaper articles and video clips are used as content for lessons. These articles and clips are grouped into the different principles to inculcate the habit amongst students to  **S**ense, **T**hink, **A**ct **R**esponsibly in their online activities. These materials are used as discussion points in the lessons.

**ASSESSMENT AND CERTIFICATION**<br>
Students are trained and provided with the opportunity to undertake the **International Computer Driver License (ICDL)** certification, endorsed by the Workforce Development Authority (WDA) as part of the Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ).

The attainment of the internationally recognised ICDL certification will help to enhance their employability and complement their education pursuits upon graduation.
