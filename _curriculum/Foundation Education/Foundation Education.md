Vision<br>
The ability to speak and write English effectively is an essential skill in the workplace. In support of NLS’s mission to provide an engaging career oriented education for youth and prepare them for lifelong learning and employability, the Language and Literacy Programme seeks to prepare students to be _effective communicators_ in the main language of work and business, as well as to facilitate future skills upgrading.
