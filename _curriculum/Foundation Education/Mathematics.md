**VISION**<br>
A mathematical programme that prepare youth at work and community.

NorthLight School adopted the Mathematics Framework from the Ministry of Education (Singapore) mathematics curriculum.

The framework sets the direction for and provides guidance in teaching, learning and assessment of mathematics, as a continuation from their primary school years.

**APPROACH**<br>
The department adopt the MOEâ€™s ICAN Principles in our teaching methodology.

Through these principles, we aim to equip our students with foundational mathematical concepts and skills to meet the general demands of life at home and at work, and also for participation in the community. At the same time, students must be able to appreciate mathematics as essential and relevant to daily life; demonstrate confidence in the use of mathematics, and perseverance in solving problems in practical and relevant situations.

A key outcome of the programme is the ability to demonstrate their competency level during the Workplace Numeracy test.
