## APEX GAMES

**APEX Games** <br>
The APEX games was conceptualised and rolled out in 2018. Having learnt many different skills throughout year one to four in NorthLight School, the APEX games aims to let the students make use of their learnt skills as they come to the end of their final year in NorthLight School. The APEX Games includes orienteering on foot, cycling expedition, water carnival, sports fiesta and inclusive sports and games. The APEX games is non-assessable as it is meant to serve as a revision of the skills the students have learnt and to let the students apply these skills while enjoying themselves at the same time.
