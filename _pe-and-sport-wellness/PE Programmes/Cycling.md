## CYCLING

**Cycling** <br>
Since 2017,  NorthLight school has been organising Cycling programmes for students as a Level programme. The Cycling programme allows the opportunities for students to learn and demonstrate the Habits OF Mind during the programme.  Here, students discuss and relate with their peers on how Habits Of Mind can be transferred to their school work and beyond school.
