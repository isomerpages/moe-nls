## SPORTS & GAMES

**Sports & Games**<br>
In Sports & Games, game concepts and strategies are consciously weaved into appropriate game situations, together with the emphasis of our adopted Habits of Mind in order to provide a holistic experience for our students. The curriculum has undergone refinement and alignment in 2017 that alludes closer to the Revised MOE PE syllabus of 2014. The SW department has begun to revisit and enhance its SOW to ensure that the components that make up the Year 1 to 4 PE curriculum, are progressive and spiral. Signature events such as Sports Day/Fiesta and Great Outdoor Experience (GOE) serve as platforms for our students to display their learnings. Other sporting platforms such as Inter-Class Games/Amazing Race/ Aquatics Carnival also enable our students to display their sports skills and knowledge/concepts that they have acquired in a competitive setting.
