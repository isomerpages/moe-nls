## AQUATICS PROGRAMME

**Aquatics Programme**<br>
For many years, NorthLight students have been enrolled in the SwimSafer Programme. Starting 2018, the PE department has re-considered the programme and reconfigured it to make it more relevant for our students. The NorthLight Aquatics Programme is designed such that students who have completed the programme will be comfortable in the swimming pool. For the students who have persevered and strived to do their best, they would also have been able to swim a length of 25m or 50m. The rationale is such that even on their own, students will be comfortable and confident enough to visit any swimming pool and swim on their own.
