## SCHEME OF WORK

**SCHEME OF WORK**

The PE Scheme of Work is planned and designed with progression of skills in mind. Students will go through the Basic and Advance Outdoor Education modules that will lead up to the using of the skills learnt for the Outward Bound Singapore camp in year three. Character Education is weaved into the PE curriculum as with the regular strength, fitness and conditioning. As the students enter into year four, which includes a full term of IEP attachment, they are exposed to an alternative form of physical activity in the Martial Arts module which includes Capoeira and MMA elements. At the end of year four, students will take part in the APEX Games that covers all the skills they have learnt throughout the year one to four during the PE lessons.
