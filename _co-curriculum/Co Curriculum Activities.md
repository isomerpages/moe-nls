CCA (Co-Curricular Activities) is an important component of character education in NLS, and forms a part of the holistic, well-rounded education that we seek to provide for our students.

**OBJECTIVES OF CCA:**

CCA provides all-round development in students in the following ways:

*   it provides for physical, social and mental development
*   it inculcates a sense of belonging to the school
*   it provides opportunities for leadership experience and development of leadership potential
*   it promotes social integration
*   it develops healthy lifestyles
