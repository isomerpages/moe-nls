**RIPPLES CLUB**

The RIPPLES Club focuses on developing in our students the skills of Reading, Presenting, Listening and Speaking, with the first letter of each skill found in the word "RIPPLES".

Learning to listen, read and speak better helps one be more confident in themselves and can create a ripple effect in their lives. We hope that through participation in the RIPPLES Club, students also develop a lifelong interest and find meaning in the spoken and written words around them.

In RIPPLES Club, students will learn to improve their reading, presenting, listening and speaking skills through authentic, meaningful and engaging activities crafted around the themes of food, art, travel and nature.
