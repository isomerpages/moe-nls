## TABLE TENNIS

**OBJECTIVES:**

Table Tennis CCA comprise mostly non-competitive groups of paddlers. CCA members are introduced to play techniques such as stroke play, footwork, ball control, service, defence and attack strategies.

Regular practice play during CCA will drill members to improve on their dexterity, quick reflexes, speed, power and agility. Our members are nurtured both physically and mentally to stretch their potential. Dedication and enthusiasm towards the game will be instilled in the CCA members to achieve discipline, teamwork and sportsmanship.

To enable students to:<br>
1 \.  Take up Table Tennis as a platform to stay active, fit and healthy<br>
2 \.  Learn basic and advanced table tennis skills<br>
3 \.  Be grounded in character values and develop their character through sports<br>
4 \.  Learn the value of teamwork through sports
