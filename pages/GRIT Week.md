## G.R.I.T WEEK

G.R.I.T (Growing Resilience in Teenagers) Week is a new initiative that sees the involvement of the entire student population in a series of deliberately planned out-of-classroom activities designed around pushing and stretching them to develop the capacity in overcoming difficulties and experiencing success. GRIT Week ( 22 to 26 Feb) was conceptualised, planned and managed by the Sports Wellness Department with our Form Teachers and Co Form Teachers playing an important role in facilitating the learning experiences of their charges. The plethora of activities called upon the skills and knowledge our students have been exposed to, taught and garnered throughout their time in NLS via their Outdoor Education and Sports & Games Modules – Hiking with nature as a backdrop (Bukit Timah Nature Reserve/Railway) , kayaking through mangroves (Sungei Khatib Bongsu), exploring man-made caving and challenge cube units @ Home Team Bukit Batok , cycling and trekking along Park Connectors (Jurassic Mile @ ECP, Kallang Basin Waterway) and working as teams through various sports and carnival games etc.  Everyday ended with Form Teachers and Co Form Teachers debriefing, facilitating and re capping the learnings of their charges in preparation and anticipation of the next day’s activities; memories of the day were also captured in pictures and videos. The last day of GRIT Week was a summation and presentation by the student participants via ICT format(Zoom), stand-up presentations and creation of Artefacts facilitated by Form Teachers and Co Form Teachers through a series of guided questions that exemplified their learnings; these learnings would then be concretized in their daily school and home/work lives.
