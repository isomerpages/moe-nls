## NEW HOPE FOR PSLE ‘NO-HOPERS’

<img src="/images/New Hope.jpg" style="width:85%">

When Mrs Chua Yen Ching was recruiting a pioneer team of teachers for NorthLight School – a specialised school that takes in those who fail their Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) – 10 years ago, one of her first thoughts was: “Who would want to teach the weakest students in Singapore?”

But, to Mrs Chua’s surprise, 150 educators did, turning up for a recruitment talk in March 2006.

“I told them, ‘If you do not have experience working with this group of children, don’t apply,’ ” the founding principal of NorthLight said.

“I felt that the mission was a tough one, so those who join must not only be passionate but competent. If not, they will feel very discouraged.”

A total of 96 teachers – including award-winning ones – later applied for the initial 20 teaching jobs available. Some were even willing to give up their head of department roles to teach at the school.

Said Mrs Chua, 58: “We had to start from scratch. It was something not done before.”
