## ASSESSMENT

**ASSESSMENT**<br>
Students are assessed in an authentic setting or game-like situation. Assessment for learning (AFL) is adopted during the curriculum and ongoing formative feedback are also given to the students throughout the module to help the students to improve their skills and understanding of a concept. In addition, the students are also being assessed in their affective domain on participation during PE, through Habits of Mind. The overall Sports & Wellness module grade will be reflected in the studentâ€™s statement of results at the end of each semester. (AAA - Attendance, Attitude, Attire)
