**HEAR FROM OUR MEMBERS…**

Name of parent: **Madam Nur Aidila** <br>
Names of children: **Mikhail Fitri & Israfil Fitri** <br>
Class: **2T5 \[Year 2020\]**

I am the proud mother of twins, Mikhail and Israfil who are currently in their second year in Northlight School (NLS). Both my sons have struggled to keep up with their studies in their primary school and as far back as I can remember, their examination results have always been below average. Consequently, they both failed their PSLE very badly and enrolled in NLS.

During their first year in NLS, I was quite worried if they would continue to struggle in their studies and how they would cope with new demands in a new school environment. There were a lot of questions on my mind when the twins initially began their life in NLS. They had to put up with daily enquiries from me; on their school day, were their teachers helpful and patient with them and more importantly could they cope with the school curriculum. To my pleasant surprise, their responses were always positive! The change from their primary school demeanour was remarkable! Where previously I would have to drag them to wake up for school, now it was evident that they always looked forward to going to school and would always update me on their daily progress in school.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Mikhail and Israfil’s form teachers Ms Theresa and Mr Ramesh for the work they have done with my boys and the class in general. Ms Theresa is always on hand to accede to any requests that I might have and to update me on the performance of the twins in school. Mr Ramesh has always been a steady presence in building rapport with the class and never fails to check in on my boys on a regular basis. For that, I am most grateful.

When the results of the twins’ first year results were released, I was in tears. For the first time in their schooling years they had registered passes in all their academic subjects. Despite my initial misgivings, NLS had made these amazing results possible by inculcating a love for learning in my boys and help build up their confidence and self-esteem. The icing on the cake was when the twins received bursary awards for good academic performance during their first year in NLS!

I am so thankful to all the teachers in NLS that have helped and given encouragement to my boys in their journey so far. The school really lives up to its ethos of “NEVER GIVE UP” in helping all its students. My children is proof that NLS teachers will really go the extra miles to assist any student under their care and build them up for the future by inculcating good character values and providing a viable education for life. Their efforts have created hope for their students where there might have been none and I’m sure that there are a whole host of thankful NLS parents out there. Good job teachers!

With regards to the future, I hope that my boys can achieve their goals in life and continue their journey to ITE and enrol in courses of their choice after they graduate from NLS. I know my boys will never forget their time in NLS and what the school has done for them. Thank you NLS!
