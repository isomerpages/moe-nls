## PSG EVENTS

On a beautiful weekend morning, signaling the start of October, a long awaited reunion finally took place between paNorthlight School and its Parent Support Group (PSG) following the long hiatus caused by the pandemic.

PSG members both current and associates, signed up for the baking course with our erstwhile chefs from the Hospitality Department with many professing that it would be their first time baking. According to our chefs during the event, this would prove to be "fake news" as many of our parents showed great skill and knowledge in executing instructions and asking quality questions that were technical in nature!

There was much fun and laughter in the session that followed and kudos to all participants who were attentive throughout the instruction phase and passionately set about the preparation of ingredients, the battering and finally the baking with much gusto!

The action in the kitchen was certainly a picture of hustle and bustle as all participants embraced the "Bake-off" challenge.
