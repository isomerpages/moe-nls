## FRIENDS OF NORTHLIGHT

NorthLight School seeks to build strong and purposeful partnerships to provide support and opportunities for meaningful learning experiences for our students. The additional support from our partners enhances and complements the existing resources and programmes that we have put in place. A Partners Framework was established to ensure that partnerships are purposeful and aligned to the school’s vision, mission and values.
